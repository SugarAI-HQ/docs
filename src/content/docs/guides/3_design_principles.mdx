We envision a future of AI where UI/UX is entirely fluid and dynamic, adapting seamlessly to user intent and context. As AI advances, this vision becomes increasingly feasible, improving as LLMs evolve.

Here are a few fundamentals:

- **Zero Learning Curve**: Users should effortlessly accomplish tasks without the need for app-specific learning. AI seamlessly assists or executes tasks based on clear user intent.

- **Open System**: Today, integrating APIs can be cumbersome. However, with Gen AI, we envision a world free of API integration hassles. By utilizing text interfaces as the primary mode of communication, AI agents can seamlessly integrate and operate across various apps and services, fostering a more interconnected and efficient ecosystem.

- **AI Safety**: Data privacy and security are paramount for building trust in AI assistants. Transparency regarding data handling practices is essential for ensuring user confidence.

- **Language Support**: With over 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, only a fraction of them are widely used. Yet, each language deserves respect and recognition. Native language support ensures that all users can interact with technology in their preferred language, promoting inclusivity and dignity for every individual.
