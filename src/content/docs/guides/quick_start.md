## Prerequisites

Before using this package, ensure you have the following:

- An existing React application
- Sugar AI [Account](https://play.sugarcaneai.dev) or [Self Hosted](https://github.com/SugarAI-HQ/CopilotOne/)


## Install
You can install the `@sugar-ai/copilot-one-sdk` package via npm:


### Instal Package

Install the package in to your React Application

````bash
npm install @sugar-ai/copilot-one-sdk@latest
````

### Create Copilot 
Login/Sigup [Account](https://play.sugarcaneai.dev) or [Self Hosted](https://github.com/SugarAI-HQ/CopilotOne/)

Create a Copilot and get the  `copilotId` and `token`

### Add to your React App

In your main file. src/App.tsx

```js
import { useCopilot, CopilotConfigType, CopilotProvider, VoiceAssistant } from '@sugar-ai/copilot-one-js';


const copilotConfig: CopilotConfigType = {
  copilotId: '<copilotId>',
  server: {
    endpoint: 'http://play.sugarcaneai.dev/api',
    token: '<token>',
  },

  ai: {
    defaultPromptTemplate: '<prompt template>',
    defaultPromptVariables: {
      $NAME: 'Sugar',
    },
    successResponse: 'Task is completed',
    failureResponse: 'I am not able to do this'
  },
}

// Wrap the App with Copilot Provider

    <CopilotProvider config={copilotConfig}>
      <TodoApp />
    </CopilotProvider>
```

### Add Voice Assistant

Add the Voice assistant to the pages you want to. If you want to enable it on all the pages, add it to common section.

```js
      <VoiceAssistant 
        promptVariables={{ $NAME: 'Sugar' }} 
        position={'botttm-center'}
      >
        
      </VoiceAssistant>
```

This will show a mic button on the bottom center of the page. Test it out if you talk with it. This Assistant have no registered actions


### Register Actions

To invoke actions by AI Assistant, register methods using `registerAction` with its name, definition and callback.

```js
const TodoApp = () => {

  ...

  // Functionalies
  const addTodo = (task) => {...}};
  const deleteTodo = (task) => {...};
  const markTodoAsDoneById = function (todoId: number) {...};

  // Register addTodo function
  registerAction(
    'addTodo',
    {
      name: 'addTodo',
      description: 'Add a new todo',
      parameters: [
        {
          name: 'task',
          type: 'string',
          description: 'Task description',
          required: true,
        }
      ],
    },
    addTodo,
  );

...

}

```

After this, ask Assistant to perform the action by saying `Remind to get a haircut`. In you app you can use equivalent instruction.


### Active Screen Context 

To make AI Assistant aware of the current screen content, use `useStateEmbedding` to track the current screen content. 

`useStateEmbedding` is build on too of `useState` hook. This automatically create an embedding in db for the current user with a scope. 

you can easily replace your `useState` hook with `useStateEmbedding` and pass the scope as the second argument. This will define the scope for created embedding.


Check out the todo App exmaple below
`useStateEmbedding`

```js

const TodoApp = () => {

const { useStateEmbedding, registerAction, unregisterAction } = useCopilot(); // Add
const scope = {scope1: 'todoApp', scope2:  'todos'}

// const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
const [todos, setTodos] = useStateEmbedding([], {...scope}); // Switch

...

}

```





Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.
