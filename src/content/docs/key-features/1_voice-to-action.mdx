A user can speak in natural language to the AI assistant to trigger registered actions on the application. 


For example, in a Todo App, user can say `Remind to get a hair cut`, and it will add `haircut` to the todo list


<Image src={vta} style={{ display: "block", margin: "auto" }} height={800} alt="voice to action image" />
